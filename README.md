## Introduction

Price predictors are one of the main types of tools that can be designed with artificial intelligence and machine learning. As part of our training at BeCode, we had the opportunity to design such a model and deploy it as a web application.

Here we wish to share the results of this enriching and fruitful experience.


## Description

The project was organised in four phases:

1. Web scraping;
2. Data visualization;
3. Modeling (Machine learning);
4. Deployment.

The first phase consisted of scraping the website of the famous company [**immoweb**](https://www.immoweb.be/en) to create a relevant dataset of real estate properties in Belgium. The data collected were stored in a structured manner as a json file.

In the second phase of the project, the json file was conveted into a pandas DataFrame. The latter was then cleaned to perform an exploratory data analysis and to make insightful visualizations. This work allowed us to have a better understanding of the database and the field of real estate. So we were equipped for modeling.

The challenge of the third phase was to study different machine learning models, choose the best one for the situation, and trained it.

The aim of the fourth and final phase was to design and deploy a basic web application using the previously trained model.

In the following, we will detail the work carried out in the last two phases of the project.
